        "# Week 9: Files\n\n",
        "Welcome to Week 9! This week marks an important step in your Python journey as we dive into file input/output (I/O). Until now, our programs have primarily interacted with the console, taking input and printing output. However, real-world applications often need to store and retrieve data persistently. You will learn how to open files, read their content, write new data to them, and manage them safely using Python's built-in file operations. Mastering file handling is essential for working with data files, configuration files, and log files."
