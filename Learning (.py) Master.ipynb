        "# Python Programming Course Syllabus\n\n",
        "Welcome to the Python Programming Course! This course is designed to introduce you to the fundamentals of programming using Python, focusing on computational thinking and problem-solving. It's a **self-paced**, **interactive**, and **open-source** learning experience. You'll engage with practical exercises, mini-projects, and unit tests directly within Jupyter notebooks, guided by the excellent 'Think Python 2e' textbook and the 'Python Data Science Handbook'. Let's get started on your journey to thinking like a computer scientist!\n\n",
        "## Course Objectives\n\n",
        "Upon successful completion of this course, students will be able to:\n",
        "*   Understand basic Python syntax, data types, and control flow.\n",
        "*   Write, debug, and troubleshoot Python programs effectively.\n",
        "*   Work with fundamental data structures like strings, lists, dictionaries, and tuples.\n",
        "*   Implement modular programming practices using functions, modules, and packages.\n",
        "*   Perform basic data manipulation and visualization using Pandas and Matplotlib.\n",
        "*   Apply computational thinking to solve real-world problems using Python.\n\n",
        "## Course Structure\n\n",
        "This course is divided into four main modules, each building upon the last to solidify your understanding of Python programming and computational thinking. Each week focuses on a specific topic with interactive labs, mini-projects, and unit tests.\n\n"

Lists are ordered, mutable collections of items, allowing you to store and manage multiple pieces of data in a single variable. You will learn how to create lists, access and modify their elements, perform various operations like adding and removing items, and iterate through them. Mastering lists is essential for handling collections of data effectively in Python."

Dictionaries are unordered collections of data values, used to store data values like a map, which, unlike other data types that hold only a single value as an element, holds `key:value` pairs. Understanding dictionaries is crucial for handling data where items are related by keys, such as user profiles, configuration settings, or data records. You will learn how to create, access, modify, and iterate through dictionaries."

Tuples are ordered, immutable collections of items, similar to lists but with the key difference that their contents cannot be changed after creation. You will learn how to create tuples, access their elements, and understand their practical uses, especially in scenarios involving data that should not be altered. We'll also cover tuple packing and unpacking, powerful features for working with multiple values efficiently."

Until now, our programs have primarily interacted with the console, taking input and printing output. However, real-world applications often need to store and retrieve data persistently. You will learn how to open files, read their content, write new data to them, and manage them safely using Python's built-in file operations. Mastering file handling is essential for working with data files, configuration files, and log files."

We will begin exploring the Pandas library, a foundational tool for data manipulation and analysis in Python. You'll learn how to work with Pandas Series and DataFrames, which are powerful data structures designed to make working with tabular data both easy and intuitive. Mastering Pandas is crucial for anyone looking to work with data in Python, enabling you to load, clean, transform, and analyze datasets efficiently."

        "1.  **Create a DataFrame:** Create a Pandas DataFrame representing sales data. It should have at least the following columns:\n",
        "    *   `Product` (e.g., 'Laptop', 'Mouse', 'Keyboard', 'Monitor')\n",
        "    *   `Region` (e.g., 'East', 'West', 'North', 'South')\n",
        "    *   `Sales` (random integer values between 100 and 1000)\n",
        "    *   `Units Sold` (random integer values between 1 and 20)\n",
        "    Ensure you have at least 10 rows of data.\n",
        "2.  **Calculate Total Revenue:** Add a new column named `Revenue` to the DataFrame. Assume `Price per Unit = Sales / Units Sold` (handle potential division by zero by setting `Revenue` to `Sales` if `Units Sold` is 0 or NaN, or just use `Sales` as `Revenue` for simplicity).\n",
        "3.  **Group by Product:** Calculate the total `Revenue` and `Units Sold` for each `Product`.\n",
        "4.  **Group by Region:** Calculate the total `Revenue` for each `Region`.\n",
        "5.  **Find Top Selling Product (by Revenue):** Identify which product generated the highest total revenue."

        "    *   `Region` (e.g., 'East', 'West', 'North', 'South')\n",

        "    Ensure you have at least 10 rows of data.\n",

Building on our work with Pandas, you'll learn how to effectively represent your data graphically, uncovering patterns and insights. We'll cover fundamental plot types like line plots, scatter plots, and bar charts, as well as essential customization techniques such as adding labels, titles, and legends. Mastering data visualization is crucial for communicating your data analysis findings clearly and persuasively."
