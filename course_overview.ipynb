This course is designed to introduce you to the fundamentals of programming using Python, focusing on computational thinking and problem-solving. It's a **self-paced**, **interactive**, and **open-source** learning experience. You'll engage with practical exercises, mini-projects, and unit tests directly within these Jupyter notebooks, guided by the excellent 'Think Python 2e' textbook and the 'Python Data Science Handbook'. Let's get started on your journey to thinking like a computer scientist!"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"PESoKbGBOxuI"},"source":["## Course Modules Overview\n","\n","Our course is divided into four main modules, each building upon the last to solidify your understanding of Python programming and computational thinking.
